### Functional Programming in simple terms

ROBERT C. MARTIN
> The first rule of the functions is that they should be small. The second rule of the functions is they should be smaller than that.

#### What is functional Programming?, and Why does that matters?
**f(X) = Y**
A function ``f`` that takes ``X`` as its argument and returns the output ``Y``. ``X`` and ``Y`` can be of any number.

 - A function must always takes an argument
 - A function must always return a value
 - A function should act only on its receiving arguments(i.e. X) not the outside world
 - For a given ``X`` there will be only one ``Y``
